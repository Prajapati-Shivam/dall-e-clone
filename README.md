This repository contains a DALL·E Clone project, which aims to replicate the functionality of OpenAI's DALL·E model. DALL·E is a deep learning model that generates images from textual descriptions.

## Features

- Generate images based on textual prompts.
- Interactive user interface to enter prompts and view generated images.
- Random prompt generator for surprise prompts.
- Download the generated images.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- OpenAI API: Used for generating images based on textual prompts.
- FileSaver: Library for saving files on the client-side.
